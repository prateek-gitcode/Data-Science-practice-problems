Ram and internal Memory.8. Processor is super fast.9. All 4 Camera working perfectly, i love macro camera.10. Beast for Gaming.11. Build quality is awesome just side with plastic xiomi can give metal at sides.Cons:1.While watching YouTube,video quality is poor, why!!! i don't understand as in other videos it is good.2.

  one of the best mobile under this price. This phone is awesome. I have 5 start. to light weight, great feature, photo quality with ultra wide angel, micro & 64 megapixel is awesome. I so lucky I got this phone on First sale with 10% discount. After using more than 3 weeks, I didn't find any issue. Battery backup is awesome, I usually charge only one time in day. after heavy use of internet, gaming like PUBG, call of duty, videos and watching online movies, still Battery backup good. Liquid cooling technology is good, after playing PUBG continually more than 2 hours, mobile little bit heat. but just rest of 3 or  5 minute, mobile get cool. Overall this phone is awesome which give separate nano sim support means we can insert two sim in different slot.

  Redmi Note 8 Pro Specifications:6.53-inch full HD+ (1080p) display | MediaTek G90T octa-core processor | 6GB or 8GB RAM with 64GB or 128GB storage with expandable storage support up to 512GB |  64MP main camera + 8MP ultra-wide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth camera + 20MP camera | 4500 mAh battery with 18W fast charging | MIUI 10 with Android Pie (9) |Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: CameraThis is the part which Xiaomi is hyping up, given there’s a 64MP camera out here. The automatic resolution is 16MP. The camera produces bright photos with accurate color tones, even at night. The selfies are impressive on this phone, and it creates a nice depth in Portrait mode, though it is not all perfect with edges on the hair.Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Performance, batteryGames like Asphalt 9, Badland, Nova Legacy all ran without any hitches. I switched Asphalt 9 to high graphics settings and the phone had no problems handling it. The graphics looked smooth without any lag. In regular usage, be it just browsing on social media or using the phone to edit photos to keeping 20 tabs open on Chrome, the experience was smooth.The only issue I noticed, the phone also got warm around the top when gaming for too long. On the battery front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro has a 4500 mAh battery. The 18W fast charger ensures a full charge in under two hours. With moderate usage, you can go up to two days on this phone, while heavy-duty usage means around one and a half days on the device.The Redmi Note 8 Pro runs MIUI 10 based on Android Pie. Xiaomi has said it will get MIUI 11 by the end of December. It does come with Alexa pre-loaded, though Google Assistant is there as well.Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Design, DisplayThe Redmi Note 8 Pro has a curved back design, though this is a broad and bulky device compared to the previous variant. One reason is the bigger battery. Redmi Note 8 Pro also has a bigger display at 6.53-inches, with the full HD+ resolution. The curved back means it is easier to hold this with one hand, but the size of the device might not always make it possible.The positioning of the fingerprint sensor right at the bottom of the camera module is not ideal either, because you will end up touching the lens like I did and covering it with smudges. The macro camera is placed away from the other three sensors to the right with flash on top of it. The idea here is to let people use flash to add more light when using macro shots.The display on the Redmi Note 8 Pro continues to be one of the best for its price. It does come with Widevine L1 certification you can stream content at HD or full HD on YouTube, Netflix, etc. The viewing angles are good, and this is a sharp display, which works well in most scenarios.

  I observed that this phone is getting heat when you use more than 5-10 min for calls/camera/ video. Also the picture quality is low.Not sure whether I received any faulty device and ordered for replacement, lets observe new device.

  People will regret after buying this mobile.Cons:1. The heating issue, even if you install apps, the mobile is getting heat.2. No L1 Support, even if it shows, Amazon Prime and Netflix is not supported HD.3. Call Quality issues.4. Don't trust reviewers guys, the green color looks, So cheap. If you guys buying better go with White color or black.5. Camera Quality is average.overall , its a bad purchase.

  Read this review, if Planning to buy Redmi Note 8 Pro.Bought Redmi Note 8 Pro in first sale, using it extensively, pretty satisfied with overall experience so far.Battery: 5/5Performance: 5/5Display: 4/5Camera: 5/5#Pro's:1. Superb Gaming performance2. Multitasking is smooth.3. Liquid cooling system which cools down your device & device doesn't get heated even while gaming.4. Amazing camera.5. Alexa support, which is first time available on any mobile.6. Dedicated SD card slot.7. P2i coating to save device from water splashes.8. Gorilla glass 5 on front as well as on back.9. 18 watt charger inside box.10. IR Blaster.11. Notification led.12. Headphone jack is still there.13. Fingerprint sensor is placed little too high but it faster than usual in display fingerprint sensors.#Con's:1. No AMOLED display.  :(2. No in-display fingerprint sensor.3. Mediatek processor: If you are advance user & into rooting, customization, then only it will affect you. Otherwise, no need to worry.@PERFORMANCE:- Note 8 Pro comes with Helio G90T mediatek cheapset which having mediatek hyper engine that is well optimized for gaming, also it offers Game Turbo mode. So, gaming experience is best on this device.Tried PUBG, COD in high settings, it was lag free without any frame drops.- In Antutu Benchmark test, Helio G90T scores much better than Snapdragon 712.@BATTERY:- 4500 mAh of Battery gets fully charged in approx 2 hrs with 18 w charger (which comes inside box), with moderate usage, it easily lasts for more than a day.@CAMERA:- 64 MP Quad cam captures amazing portraits.

  Well you need to wait for this product :) bought on sale October second sale, a premium phone in this range

  Glad to be the first one to write a review for this phone! The Picture clarity in the Rear Camera is very detailed with proper light effects in case of LOW / VERY Low Light, the 64MP Option should be used when you have no worry about storage space and you know that every single Photo that you will take using this option will be 10MB+ going up to 25MB depending on the details captured in the image.The Front Camera of 20MP is also very stable and takes good images.It is nice to say that Redmi does not apply any default BEAUTIFICATION effect to your photos just like REALME does!Actually, I had purchased this phone to replace my iPhone 6s, however, I was totally dissatisfied as there is No software for any data transfer between iPhone and Redmi for that matter Redmi phones do not have any INBUILT application for data transfer from Android to Android or iOS to Android which is why the rating is reduced by 2 Points. It seems to me that Redmi has manufactured and thought of mobile phones for FIRST TIME BUYERS only! So this issue is not addressed, and maybe it can be looked into if they want to! In comparison, if you check for M30s from Samsung (similar specs and price), you get a default option of moving your data including SMS, Contacts, Photos etc without any problems from iOS or Android!About the return option and contacting Amazon / Redmi, the Customer Care at Amazon are absolutely clueless and will not say a word about the purchase, will simply ask you to contact the customer care of Apple OR Redmi (whatever are the 2 phones that you have - Old and New), the Redmi Customer Care person will say you can download the apps called XANDER etc, which are of no use and third-party apps which won't help at all in any transfer of data.Please note that though AMAZON may mention RETURN POSSIBLE UP TO __ NOV 2019, actually you cannot return the phone unless the phone is received in a PHYSICALLY DAMAGED condition which would have to be proved to Amazon by sending the Photos to them and if they think it is genuine, else RETURN IS NOT POSSIBLE!!!All in all a good phone for first-time buyers (considering the camera specs and price point), but a clear NO for migration! Also if you don't want to keep the phone or you are thinking that you will buy, check, decide and return then please note that it doesn't work!

  It is the best option to buy a gaming mobile at this price range. Visit my YouTube channel \"Indian Tech Helper\" for mobile related videos.Pros:Everything is good given on product page.Cons:Battery drains little bit faster.Camera has to be improved.Camera bump is more.A case with Camera protection is recommended.By the way these all are minor cons. Some may fixed by updates.If you ask me then I recommend you to buy without any problem.

  Well, I was waiting long for this mobile, but when I received it my dreams were shattered. On the very first sale in bought this mobile. When I removed the tampered  (plastic covering screen ) there were scratches on the screen. I wonder what happened to the control check of xiaomi? How can they so carelessly sell the mobile without proper inspection? This reflects how customer oriented they are! About the phone functioning I cannot comment any thing as I did not use it more than 20 minutes . But one thing is for sure, if things are sold without proper  inspection and quality check, what being a customer we receive is going to be a \"CRAP\".

  Been using the phone for 2 weeks and it's safe to say that it's worth your money. Performance being the strong point is top notch..no complaints here. Even the display being IPS is great too.Design is sleek and premium unlike previous redmi phones. For the temps it definitely heats (which the the primary concern since the day it was announced)...but its not an issue,definitely not...at least not in my unit and it is cool and stable when not gaming. What my concern was it's battery ,maybe the g90t is power hungry and 4500mah lasts almost a day..I wished it to last for the next half too. I hope redmi fix in an ota update <U+0001F91E>, the 18watt charger comes as a life saver here, it was a must and thanks redmi for providing it in the box.....will update this review in the future after long term use....Is this phone worth your money <U+0001F4B0>-YES...

  I think I received defective product.. issue in camera focusing. I posted some photos. You can see images that are going blurry on edges. Alexa also not working.Read my Full review --Other Things Are good. Processing is best. Front Camera is good not best. Wide angle camera quality is not expected. Macro shots are good. Call qualily also very good and speaker sound is ok.Display Quality is Great.Fingerprint senser is very responsive and Very Fast. Face unlock is ok.. not secureGaming Performance is also very good. i played PubG without any lags. Little heating issues found.It is taking 2 hours for full charging. It will give one day battery backup easily.

  I researched almost a past 2 months and I came to know that this phone has some powerful processor... Which was highlighted features of Xiaomi.. Even i came to know about heating issues about this phone which was highlighted by reviewers on YouTube.. although this phone heats a lots .. without playing any single game because i am person who usually don't likes to play games on phones ..after a normal or light use this phone allows heating issue ..and infact at a certain point of time this phone also have lacking problem which is so disappointing for me ... Because the claims about terrific performance of this phone .. it heats upto 49°C while using camera in witer season and i think you guys have enough thinking skills to predict what will happen in summer season...

Security perspective not satisfied ( they hides our logged in details and then we have to find the account and log it out).5. Simple Display ( not amoled )6. Google features are lacking i.e no direct shortcut for google, Gmail search ( problem in multiple mail logins ).4 star for 64 MP camera...

  Best mobile you can get under 18k segment. It has a beautiful display, great processer, above average camera, average battery even though it has 4500mAh battery it's not up to the mark  but charging speed is very good. And they create hype Abou Alexa it's not worked properly on my mobile so i deleted it. I'm using Google voice assistance. overall it's above average mobile for me

  Phone get heated up in simple 30/40 minutes of simple game playing. It seems  Xiaomi has compromised in this segment  by lowering the price in comparision with realme XT. I highly recommend not to buy the phone if you can't tolerate the heating issue. Sometimes it's temperature go beyond 50 degree Celsius. This is the major draw back of redmi note 8 pro. Those who like to play game should remain away from this phone. Claim of Xiaomi is not upto the mark. Rest is ok.  Its upto you.

  Very bad product....hotspot is not working....no effect of liquid cooling,played game for 20 min and mobile start heating near camera...miui brings its own new features makes it less user friendly...camera is ok ok in this range and also u cannot zoom or record video in 64MP camera mode

  Configuration of this phone is very good that's the only reason I purchased this one. If you wish to save your money go for it.Android OS phones work well for max 2-3 years after that it you will experience same lagging issues and buy new phone.Touch is very good. No issues.Camera is enough to show true colors. If you are expecting DSLR quality then buy Camera not phone.No heating issues as of now for normal usage (calls, songs, WhatsApp, FB, you tube, office mails, Skype). Not everyone is hardcore gamers.Check reviews from hardcore gamers for pubg etc...Overall good phone at 18k (8gb, 128gb) than spending 35k++ for same configuration.

  The product has an inherent defective SIM card tray . Simcard 1 slot. Changed my phone today to discover the same defect with that too. The phone is terrific ,and I wouldn't mind a replacement ,can wait till the problem is addressed . I would have gone with 5 stars .

  Redmi Note 8 ProDESIGN  -  Solid and Well built, Front & back Gorilla Glass 5 protection with curved edges. The camera bump at the back protrudes a little even when the cover is on, may be a matter of concern. Please look for a Silicon cover to protect the camera module.PROCESSOR  -  This houses the newest chipset from MediaTek Helio G90T which is basically designed for gaming. This not only helps the phone to load & play high graphic intensive games fast & smooth, but it also helps in quick loading and swapping of Apps in a day to day usage. The overall performance is amazingly fast and buttery. Those who are complaining of heating issues, should buy ACs before buying phones for playing games for hours..STORAGE & RAM  -  This comes with the fast UFS 2.1 onboard storage that help load apps ultra-fast, as compare to old eMMC 5.1 type storage. The basic model starts with 6 GB LPDDR4 RAM with Dual Channel Enabled. This helps increase the bandwidth by double the data rate as against the single channel RAM. Everything loads amazingly fast with no lags as such.Supports up to a whopping 512 GB of storage with a dedicated Micro SD Card slot. This is what we want in every phone…DISPLAY  -  6.53” IPS LCD Panel with 395 PPI density and 2.5D curved edges. This display is of a 1080 x 2340 Resolution with HDR Enabled so the colors look very vibrant and true to life. The water drop notch looks very nice and it can be disabled from settings. Personally, to me the display looked very crisp and sharp. The brightness of this display can go up to 430nits which is very bright and display looks amazingly sharp and crisp… 4k HDR video quality on YouTube is amazing on this display...CAMERA  -  This is where it exceeds all other phones. The default 12 MP Camera takes nice pictures in all modes. The 64 MP mode can be enabled from the camera app and it captures amazing pictures with great clarity colours and contrast. The pictures with 64 MP camera come out to be very crisp and with lots of details. But the image size for 64 MP camera would be approximately around 15 MB per picture. This can record the videos up to 4k Resolution. However, Full HD videos will have an Electronic Stabilization enabled by default which produces great videos. Macros also come very crisp considering that this is a Mobile camera but, not the DSLR.Front 20 MP Camera also captures wonderful selfies with lots of detail. This can record videos up to Full HD resolution. This phone does a great job in Camera department. This will surely satisfy your hunger for great pictures…Those who are looking for Gcam support, should take mobiles that support it or should buy google phones instead of complaining about this phone. The company has offered a good package with great camera and it does a wonderful job. People who are looking for an astonishing clarity Camera then they should look for a DSLRs or buy flagship phones.Attaching few pictures for reference…CONNECTIVITY  -  Supports Dual 4G VoLTE on both SIM Cards simultaneously. Dual Band Wi-Fi that increases both Upload and Download speeds dramatically if connected to Wi-Fi 5GHz connection.Comes with Bluetooth 5 with LE (Low Energy) mode on that helps preserve battery drain..BATTERY  -  A Whopping 4500 mAh Battery with Quick Charge support.VERDICT  -  One Word – A Monster in all aspects, be it a Design, Style, Battery, Display and Camera. Except its weight of 200Gms, this is one piece of art and technology that nobody wants to miss having it…Every product will have their own issues and bugs, including flagships that can be fixed with a software update.  And every product cannot be compared with another since everything has its own existence and importance.Thanks to Amazon for safe packaging and fast delivery…

  after using more than 10 days. the honest review is here lets talk in points and i will try to give you every answer1 built quality- excellent quality and looks great but it is bit heavy becouse you will definately use a case with this phone otherwise you will feel risk .without back cover looks great and will not feel heavy and another thing is that camera is quit out from body so there are chances of getting scraches2. sound- you will miss dolby sound. the sound is good and moderately loud but dont expect the great3. performance- thats where it beats the all. i dont think you will find that kind of performance upto rs 20-22000 mobiles. absolutely class4. PUBG- pubg lovers if you want a phone specially for pubg dont let thsis phone go .excellent gaming5. heating issue?- only if you use this phone for long time with continous gaming.and with high graphics. otherwise no issue even you watch a full movie with wifi. only while gaming after one hour on full hd graphics6. display- butter smooth display quit large and excellent display best in claass but will not produce colours as super amoled just a littel bit of diferrence between the two  but you will not find much differance in day to day life . so full marks for display7. battery- i will say a decent battery life considering 6.5 inch display and a a heavy processorcamera?- this is the biggest of alll and i am giving you a detailed review for this. camera is superb no doubt even in low light it performes vary well and after zooming the photos you will not get blur images at all. potrait mode is one of the best in this segments .but now the cons of cameraslow motion and wide camera are poor. vary poor quality i am not impressed at all. slow motion video you can capture only from short or close distance otherwise not good at all and even you cant shoot in artificial lights is well. and wide camera does not produces good quality pictures. macro camera is excellent.and the last con of camera i compaired this camera with iphone xr and vivo v15pro . in terms of details it is totally equall to them but colours of the pics is not that great but decent in comaprison you will find colours bitt dull but that does not mean they are better . they only produces better colour otherwise same. but one thing to notice both iphone and vivo captures the colour more saturated than orignal even they dont produces real colours. redmi shows littel light colours than real and xr iphone and vivo littel dark than orignal .camera is vary good and you will get good pictures and for colour you can adjust them with some photo editing. so no issues. final verdict on camera is .that it is a good camera and you will not be disspointedworth the money you spendgreat display good camera good battery good built qualitylittel heavy, sound lacks dolby quality.camera slow motion and wide angel not goodi will say only compititor for this phone is Vivo z1x in this price segment.you can buy any of this phone depends on your demands

Heating issue while using camera5 .No google camera yet6. Miui hangs sometime.7.Fingerprint sensor is badly placed with camera array, which is a bit confusing.

  I brought Redmi note 8 pro from Amazon India. This mobile is not even basic testing, it's having major issue. Upside 1st wide camera(8MP), is not at all used in camera app. Goto Pro in camera app, and select wide lens option.It's using 64mp camera instead of 8MP camera lens. In camera app, 8MP camera not at all used in any mode. Anyone can check by putting fingure on camera, with different different camera lens mode. Xiaomi making foolish by putting many cameras. If single camera can be used with all the options then why added these cameras.Some heating issue in phone, I'm ok with it. But given camera, not used, is not acceptable in any circumstances.I was called Amazon care, they just telling go to service center and take job sheet from there. But care center guys don't have knowledge of this new model.

  Redmi 8 Note Pro 8GB RAM/128GB Storage Electric Blue.I got this phone in 1day delivery commitment. I had used Mi 4, Mi Max, Mi Max2 in the past. I have been using other mobile since last 2 years. My Redmi8 Note Pro made realized what I missed so far. It's 64MP main camera array and 20MP selfie camera are simply superb. Screen and back cover are Gorilla Glass5. A smooth finish that one should feel. WiFi connectivity is awesome. I had received phone in 62%remaining charging. After rigorous usage for 10hrs it consumes 33%. Phone didn't show signs of even getting warmer, getting hanged etc., I recommend this to anyone that is looking for a best phone below 20K.

  There was some defect in dislpay of the screen. There were several white dots on display and can be seen when there is any light color on screen. This is a common problem with IPS LCD screens.I contacted amazon and they sent a technician. He raised a replacement ticket but amazon refused to replace. So i had to settle for refund and they expect me to take part in this stupid flash sale strategy again.For other buyers , please check your display and read about dead pixel on internet and how to check quality of display panel, because amazon will not help you in any case. Its better to go to other brands like Realme than having a defective mobile.

  I bought this mobile(6/64gb) on flash sale.Disadvantages:++While using in wifi, the mobile gets heating especially around the camera.++in 4g internet usage normally no heating issues, but gets heat while in travel(3hours travel)++while playing pubg, it gets heat gradually & goes around 45 degree( it gets heat slowly, but thats fine) but playing asphalt 9, it gets heavy heating within 15 minutes(adupukulla vacha mathiri irukku)++the mediatek processor is not power efficient like snapdragon processor - so dont think of 4500mah battery is huge - actually it is like 4000mah in redmi note  8 pro- heavy 1 day usage, light user-- 1.5 days)advantagesperformance - beastcamera - goodram - too goodIf you are redmi fan, wait for few months and check & buy after fixed the heating issues ( because the phone is getting heating on normal usage) - i dont know y any reveiwers are not mentioning this. Check some hindi youtube tech channels - some are addressing the issues, but not in tamil tech channelsHope redmi can fix the heating issues via updates(if possible)What i mentioned is my experience, so please  beware of heating issues - 15000 is not a small amount to get compromised.

  Using note 8 pro from last 10 days and till now not much satisfy with over all performance.Too bulky in weight. screen resolution never seem to SD even.Processing speed and processor was too good in this range that is only thing which attract.Sound was just okay, you can't expect much more from MI in this price range.Its touch is not responsive, means not smooth.Device hang while playing 4K or normal video.Let talk about so called 64MP camera, only one thing lots of issues with camera, must be fixed in upcoming updates,like sometimes hang, focus not accurate, loosing focus and images get blurred after click (even tried using tripod), getting error while image editing, pro option is not requires because it not working as pro.Till now didn't face any heating issue even while playing game or using camera. Battery backup was also too good with super fast charging.Finger print scanner also superb too quick to respond.Device Looks and design: 4.0/5.0Resolution: 3.0/5.0Processing speed: 5.0/5.0Camera: 1.0/5.0Build quality : 3.0/5.0Battery / Charging : 5.0/5.0

I don't know whether i got fault one or just people got used to heating issue as normal  but my phone is heating like anything while using internet and yeah I'M FRUSTRATED . (going to service centre for sure )13/12/19Heating got reduced without visiting Service centre but it's getting heated randomly.

  First of all, it's the best budget phone under 15k. To be frank redmi is the phone known for \"TECHNOLOGY AT AFFORDABLE COST\".Pros:1)The phone's performance is top notch2) The camera is considerably good. You can't expect much of pro pics even though they mention it as 64mp .3) The design is Ultimate. It's like competing with One plus 7 pro. It's resemble merely like a premium brand phones. The electric Blue is lit.4) Overall the phone is best for it's speedy and glassy and classy performance.Cons :1) If you're considering this phone for your privacy and banking purpose it is not at all advisable. There are a lot of advertisement and access to third parties. It is merely easily accessible by any third parties which envisages them to pop advertisement for us.2) The screen quality is OK as it is LCD. Now it's the era a of AMOLED displays.3) Heating is considerably fine .4) Prone for camera scratch so use a good back cover .

  I find the phone great...It's heavy compared to other cell phones (200 gms)I must says it's better than One Plus Series considering the functions & the price.The Night Camera is useless, but the 64 mp is great.Charging is excellent, no need to buy any additional charger 18 w is great.Video recording, Onscreen recording & Call Recording is excellent.MI interface is very smooth & easy for non MI users like me.Sound could have been bit louder, but I still love my Halo White phone.Functioning is very very smooth & it's a pleasure using it. Worth every penny of my hard earned money. I also got a discount of 1800 Rs using the Axis Bank Card.My Review after using for 2 months -Too too heavy.Too long cannot use by single hand.Heating issues during recording & also during charging.Camera is really useless.Takes too long to charge.Personally I am fed up with its weight & switching to my One Plus.

  Too unhappy with the product. First of all, Package I received was not as shown in product description. Cover and adapter cable was missing, phone I added to cart was green and I got was black. Phone is too heavy and still the battery life is not that good. Fingerprint scanning is slow.Camera is good but display not. Spending 16000 just for good camera is not worth.Samsung M30 is recommended over this phone. As it works smoother, has premium look, is lighter, have better display and performance is good, camera is of almost same quality and battery life is way too good than Redmi Note 8 Pro.

  1.Touch stops working while using the keypad.2.Portable hotspot shows you multiple device connected when you have connected only one device, number of devices connected continuously changes within seconds and notification sound of that irritates you.3. Camera is not that much good which they have mentioned.4. While using front camera night mode and 64mp options are also visible that should not be there.

  Very much disappointed by the phone. I don't know why they are advertising this phone on the ground of liquid cool technology. After half an hour of continuous use the phone is heating enormously. And the battery backup is not up to the mark. And u get better display at this price range. And this is not a gaming phone. So if any gamer who wants to buy this phone for gaming purpose, please go for another option. Overall bht bekaar phone h. Paise doob gye. Mt lena ye phone.

  I am writing review after 5 days of use for my highest configuration Redmi Note 8 pro.I bought this set with high expectations but extremely disappointed.7% battery gets drained in just  setting up the phone.18 w charging can't believe it , it took 40 mins to charge 30%.Back panel always deep oil finger prints if not cleaned immediately. 10% of battery got drained when on hotspot.I am really hoping either I get replacement for this set or refund of my money from Amazon.

  Good phone and value for money. However phone has performance and technical issues. I faced 2 technical issuesa) Proximity sensor is faulty, when sensor is on the screen goes off immediately after call is received or placed. Once screen is off you can't wake the screen by pressing on button or double tap or through finger print sensor. Screen only activates once the call is disconnected by other person. Due to this we cannot make calls to IVR as we don't get screen to select optionsb) Finger print sensor does not work if you are activating phone after 2 to 3 hours, once you have activated using on button then onwards finger print sensor will respondc) Some of the text in widgets some.up in Chinese when all other text is in English.d) had experienced lag prior to installing updatesExcept above 4 issues this is an excellent phone.

  Redmi Note 8 Pro offers a 64MP camera and the clarity of the camera is pretty decent, the front camera offers a 20MP selfie camera which is great while taking selfies. The performance of the phone is smooth and for gaming. The experience is also pretty good as there is a liquid cooling technology is used. It had built-in Alexa to control the smart devices which respond instantly. The storage capacity is also large and allows us to extend up to 512GB.Android Pie operating system is equipped for this device. The 4500mAH battery offers a decent backup for the phone. The 3D-curve design is good to hold the phone in hand to operate. Overall the phone is good to buy at this spec and price.

  I am very very disappointed with redmi note 8 pro. Bought this mobile on 30 nov 2019. And 18 dec 2019 started problem today it got hanged and went in reboot system and nit getting start . After several try it was not opening . And lastly I have to take the mobile in service center they have opened tha back cover and software updated. If within 19 days this type of problems will happen then a customer who have paid for mobile . How can except that this mobile will work properly atleast a year.  Disappointed from my side because I have wasted a full day of mine . Because of this mobile. And in service center also they took 2 and half hour to resolve . A big ? For customer . I suggest don't buy redmi note 8 pro. Very very bad

  All these fake news about overheating are totally false. I'm a hardcore GAMER and usually play for 3-4 hrs, yet no trace of overheating.Yes , it has a genuine problem, while playing the hand we do not get a comfortable hold. The camera gets smudged.Also the Camera bump is too big...just a genuine buyer with a true review <U+0001F607>

  First look: The phone handles like a beauty• Didnt have any ads Poppin up like all the reviews given in the net• Although thre were some apps installed without my permission• The main camera is good but the front camera is just trash, but can be made better using some camera apps• Installing the poco launcher is really helpful because people who were using phones from other brands also might get a similar interface•Im one of the first people to buy the electric blue colour, it does give a rather eye-catching touch but might feel a little too shiny for regular useReview after 3 weeks of use• The phone still handles like a beauty• I've tried a few games and all in high settings and they worked wonderfully• Didn't really experience any heating issues too• The battery is  amazing. U can use it with ease for 2 days• The main camera after comparing with many of the new phones released recently have given this phone the throne for one of the best smartphone camera's there is in a midrange product

  The Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro is an upgrade over the Note 7 Pro in almost every count. At least on paper. In the real world, there is a boost in gaming performance and display quality while the added Alexa integration will be welcomed by some. The camera quality remains more or less the same despite a newer sensor, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Addressing a few burning issues, we initially concluded the Note 8 Pro might be overheating during longer gaming sessions. While the phone does run warmer than say the Realme 5 Pro, it doesn’t go beyond 50 degrees, which is what we consider overheating in smartphones. The battery life of the phone is just as good as its predecessor, despite a larger battery. By the looks of it, Xiaomi took a bold step by choosing to go with a MediaTek flagship SoC and it seems to have paid off. There’s no reason why shouldn’t buy the Redmi Note 8 Pro, save for the pesky ads in the UI.#redmi #mi

  First time ever this smartphone from Xiaomi disappointed me as I was a Xiaomi fan since second smartphone from Xiaomi that is Redmi 1S launched in India. After 1S I had used many Xiaomi smartphones from Redmi Note 3, Redmi Note 4, Redmi Note 5, Redmi 2 Prime, Mi 4i, Mi A2, Poco F1, Redmi Note 7, Redmi Note 7 Pro and Mi 5. But first time ever I am disappointed with any Xiaomi smartphone and that phone is none other than Redmi Note 8 Pro. I had even visited Redmi Note 8 Pro launch event and there they showcased this smartphone that good that I wanted to purchase it. So finally I did buy the phone thinking about all these features like cooling pipe, gaming-centric smartphone and all. But finally, after spending that much money it was all worthless as the phone screen was not that good buying it for Rs 15K. Ignoring the screen camera was disgusting. And most importantly phone was getting heated as well while playing PUBG only for about 30 minutes which is disgusting to spend this much and getting nothing. And the most disgusting was that I had gone with the Halo White color which does looks shabby and cheap smartphone without cover. So either covers it forever or use it hiding with everyone.Last words never go for this smartphone ever. This was disgust phone ever which looked shabby, bulky and overpriced.

  Facing battery draining issue since last 2 days. 100% fully charged battery drained to 10% in just 5hrs without any heavy usage, In spite of having 4500 mah battery. No calls attended, no gaming, used data for just updating apps and installation. I would say my usage is below average and still i am facing this issue. Even I do have redmi note 7 pro bought from flipkart and it's been 1 year and the performance and battery backup is better than this. Watching cricket on hotstar, took 5 calls for 2, 3 hrs long and still it has 65% battery. I am sure this is a defective product and customer care doesn't care ....I called them 3 times and they told me to perform battery calibration test I did that and already factory data rest and clear the caches still it is draining way too fast. They have provided me a defective piece and not letting me return or replace. On asking they told me that they have to follow procedure and will send technician and he will not be available till 27. I asked them to speak to their supervisor and as expected I was told that all the seniors are busy right now. Very dissappointed with amazon. I need my refund.

  8 then i realised incoming call issue, but from few days thought it can be network problem but in a day or two all my incoming calls were blank like I actually attend the call but can't hear anything. Then I dialed from my wife mobile only then understood even though my phone shows I attended the call but it's still ringing on callers side. Software issue not support from Amazon as kept repeating same dialogue with terms n policy. I kindly advise better stop buying online who does not care customer rather than their policy.

  So far the device redmi note 8 pro looks great at mid price range and i can definitely say that it's the bang on successor of redmi mote 8 pro ,this particular colour gamma green in love<U+0001F60D> with this colour.Camera performance so far it's excellent still lot more to capture at the endBattery performance so far pretty nice as it is giving a day backup easily with so many work done on my redmi note 8 pro.Back cover is pretty decent but the camera bump is not protected through that cover 0.5 star minus for cover thing

  1. Electronic and costest products should be packed with in box package, but this seller simply packed with amazon COVER only thats the first drawback.2. Comming up to product, I dont know why xiaomi said its 18w fast charger but performance not as expected, taking 5-7 hours to full the charge.3. Mobile getting heat while using internet/camara /game to 15-20 mnts,  then why xiaomi inbuilt cooling technology. Dont know what is the use of that.4. Display is not effected as much as expected.5. Very irritating thing is finger prints easily stamping on back side of mobile. Thats huge problem looking very dirty.6. Coming up to camara too much of bobble  from body, thats damage very quick. I think its very big essert this model.7. Pouch is not fixing properly after installing tempered glass. So Should buy another pouch.8. Glass, touch, design are good.9. Performance quick responce.10. Camara aaswam.Finally not satisfied to bought this model  after long eagerly wait..

  Photo quality is good if you are taking pics of scenery but selfie camera is very bad. It highlights every spot on your face n even the sweat n oil though you smoothen the pics. Beautify option is not good as 5pro or 6 pro. Battery dries out very soon n takes too much time to change.. i was using Redmi note 5 pro.. that Phone' battery life is better than this phone.. Too many adds in every app, no option to shut them. Phone is quite heavy, it's definitely not for people with small palms.the cover provided with phone is pathetic, does not cover camera very well unlike the cover provided with 5 pro. One drop & camera glass willl break for sure.. Good for gaming.. pubg runs very smooth and graphics looks amazing..but it drains the battery in 2 games.. in previous version we had finger touch option for taking pics. We do not have that option in this phone.

  After 25 days of usage ( worst phone ever)*Heating issue is real, even after 15 mins of normal usage phone gets very warm from the back* Battery backup is very poor, afterall it's mediatek processor.*Screen quality is very poor, they should have provided amoled it's normal in these days.*Camera quality is very poor*Fast charging doesn't work coz it's mediatek processor and charger is Qualcomm*So many bloatwares plus spammy notifications from Xiaomi apps, plus so many ads in ui.*Sensors don't work properly*Headphone jack doesn't work properlyConclusion :- very disappointed and i would suggest everyone to ignore this phone, galti se bhi mt khareedna bhai

  1)Thus, the Redmi Note 8 Pro happens to be Xiaomi's first smartphone with a 64MP Samsung sensor, a 'gaming-oriented' MediaTek Helio G90T chipset powering the device instead of the usual Qualcomm mid-range chipset, and a battery unit that has been increased to 4500mAh.2)That said, the rivalry between Xiaomi and Realme has picked up frantic pace over the course of 2019, with both companies trying to outpace the other at every step. Having been the brand that has stood at the summit of India's smartphone market for eight straight quarters, the company certainly doesn't want to lose out relative newbies.3)Realme, meanwhile, is breaking records of its own, gaining a market share of 9% within just 15 months of existence. So does the Redmi Note 8 Pro do enough to warrant the spotlight for yet another iteration? Read on to find out.,Build and Design4)The Redmi Note 8 Pro is hands-down the most attractive looking Redmi Note series phone till date. It's striking but not over the top and that's precisely why I've loved how Xiaomi's gone about the design here. It's also worth noting that Xiaomi's typically been a brand that doesn't revise their product designs often enough. They changed that with the Redmi Note 7 Pro earlier this year and eight months down the line, they've changed it up again: this time, adding it a little more oomph to the mix.A Good Display That Could Have Been BetterOn the front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro gets a 6.53-inch FHD+ IPS LCD panel. The screen itself is seemingly identical to what Xiaomi fielded in this segment earlier this year, and you get decent colors and zero issues with sunlight legibility. But when you pay attention to competition though, namely, the Realme XT, you do get an AMOLED screen that has more vibrant colors.The reason why the comparison between LCD and OLED comes up every time is because black levels and contrast aren’t exactly as good on an LCD panel as the AMOLED screen on the Realme XT. However, the difference in quality isn’t huge either. The panel on the Redmi Note 8 Pro is just as good as LCD panels get and if you're someone who streams a ton of video content on your phone, you'll definitely have a great experience.Redmi Note 8 Pro: Performance and SoftwareXiaomi definitely raised eyebrows when they decided to go with a Mediatek SoC in the Note 8 Pro despite the Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 doing an excellent job in the Redmi Note 7 Pro. In fact, it was a big risk and the scales could have tipped either way. But as it turns out, this was a brilliant decision on Xiaomi’s part as the Mediatek Helio G90T delivers every ounce of muscle you'd expect from it and more. This is by far the most powerful on any phone priced under INR 17-18,000, one that certainly caters to all the PUBG-walas out there.Redmi Note 8 Pro: You Didn't Need To Throw In Four Cameras In There XiaomiRear:64MP f/1.79 Primary8MP f/2.2 Ultra-wide angle lens2MP Macro Lens with focus upto 2cm2MP depth sensorFront: 20MP f/2.0 Selfie shooter

  Worst company and worst product,Facing battery and heating issue within 2-3 month of purchase and than finally when i went to service center they said there is an bug's issue and they did some software but still facing same problem, than after 2-3 month again i went to service center and they said there is an issue with motherboard and we have to change it,So i submitted my phone in service center and its a week but still not received my phone back!!

  Hadn't thought about this issue but now its a hell.  I can't type with full speed. Whenever I type with maximum speed it starts typing anything randomly, I mean the random keys. Now please don't even try to tell me if I don't have enough typing speed. I've never faced any such issues with any of my phones. For the comparison I tried with my Bro's n frineds IP11pro max M40 and OP8Pro I've tried with them all but i've got no such issue. I'm so much disappointed. Phone has no other issue..its just awesome in every other department. Camera battery performence you name it.Edit1:Its been 9 months the performance is still undoubtedly great. The only thing that concerns me is the screen that doesn't capture the touches when we type faster than a certain wpm.. So the typing problem is still there.. Now i have activated autocorrection and it does require its work in 9 of 10 words I type. I have thrown my phone twice in frustration because of this Shït. I'm using Touchscreen since 2009.

  I usually don't review products on Amazon, but this one deserves special mention; so here we go..In the Box: You get handset, 18 Watt fast Charger, and a Cover, no screen guard inside the box...The cover: deserves an especial mention- it's similar to OnePlus 7 cover and has that USB flap to protect phone from water damage...The Handset: White looks almost magical; there are 2 trays side by side, which can accommodate 2 sims and a MicroSD. On the top, you will find an IR blaster, nothing new if you are a returning Xiaomi customer, but if this is your first, then just use it once and see how handy it is in controlling TV, AC and other remote control appliances...Bottom has a single speaker grill, 3.5mm Jack and USB Type-C...Switching On: It gives a haptic feedback which is quite tuned rather than the rude vibration that Redmi Note 5 pro gives, Xiaomi has worked hard to fine tune the device and it has paid well. Now starts the real torment: There are tons of options guiding you to customize the phone as you prepare for our maiden voyage and options for Ads are kinda well hidden, but more about it later.UI: Now let your eyes and mind get accustomed to MIUI; there's no app drawer and all apps are neatly grouped into folders. there's a lot of bloat, but thank the sweet Lord it's uninstallable. I would advise you to enable developer options and reduce the animations to 0.5X; the phone will be noticeably faster and less animated...Display: The HDR display is vibrant and bezels are negligible; one of the best ever seen on Redmi Note series...Camera: Of course, it's the camera phone with monstrous 64MP primary sensor; my initial impressions were good but camera tends to saturate dark colors quite a bit, and Wide Angle has quite noticeable distortion; Scared yet? Don't be cuz even after these caveats, the camera performs well specially with pro-mode; do not use 64 MP mode, the noise increases quite a bit...GCam: Here's our sweet savior again; Xiaomi has left Camera 2 api enabled, so installing GCam is pretty easy; right now, the best one has been developed by Wyroczen and you can find all about it by a single Google search; the GCam corrects most errors of he camera but do not use macro mode; it's much better on stock Camera...Speakers: The single speaker doesn't really satisfy people who've used Stereo speakers, but this fact can't take away the limelight off Note 8 pro; the speaker is loud, crisp and has a good bass due to bigger cavity...Connectivity: It is quite good and works fine; haven't seen 4G+ or carrier aggregation though...Verdict: Redmi Note 8 Pro is a fine phone with little to compromise upon; Surely a great effort from Xiaomi once again...PS: Pardon any typos.

  Just want to inform all the buyers.. This mobile is purchased to play PUBG only but the mobile is heating is reaching 45 degrees, technician visit is also provided by Amazon in orde to check the problem but he says as per standard of the company this heating causes no issues...well not sure what to do in such case.... well i dont suggest anyone to go for it....coz that much temperature of mobile may harm the internals of device....Such a bad decision <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>

  Well phone looks amazing on the outside as well as on the inside their are many unbelievable things. 64mp camera with AI . I don't find much difference in camera quality but software and buttons are different though. Alexa is what I like but have to configure it . Busy with phone configuration....will write more after further use.Now it's 8 months now the phone is working great . Played all the heavy games like pubg and other. Performance wise it's great. But little disappont ment with the camera picture quality although the phone is having 64 megapixel but picture looks very unnatural. Like some extra work is done after the picture clicked by its AI.Performance is goodCamera is also goodGraphics also greatPhone cover turns yellow , after a while.
